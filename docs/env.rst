Phishing URL Detection Environment
============================

What is this?
------------
This is a specialized AI training environment designed to help detect malicious (phishing) URLs. Think of it as a virtual gym where 
an AI agent learns to distinguish between safe and dangerous web addresses. This environment is built using industry-standard AI 
training frameworks (Gymnasium) to ensure reliable and efficient learning.

What does it do?
---------------
- Analyzes URLs to detect potential phishing threats
- Learns patterns from a comprehensive dataset of both safe and malicious URLs
- Makes binary decisions: "Safe" or "Phishing" for each URL
- Provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each decision
- Tracks and reports the AI's learning progress

How it Works
-----------
The system works in three main steps:

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Takes URL data and converts it into a format the AI can understand
   - Standardizes all features to ensure consistent learning
   - Prepares the data for efficient processing

2. **Decision Making**:
   - The AI examines each URL's characteristics
   - Makes a decision: Safe (0) or Phishing (1)
   - Gets feedback on whether the decision was correct

3. **Learning Process**:
   - Receives a reward (+1) for correct decisions
   - Receives a penalty (-1) for incorrect decisions
   - Uses this feedback to improve future decisions

Technical Details (For Developers)
--------------------------------
Implementation Specifics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Built with Gymnasium (modern AI training framework)
- Uses numpy for efficient numerical operations
- Features standardized to float32 format for consistency
- Implements standard Gymnasium interfaces for compatibility

Core Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
reset()
    Starts a new training session
    
step(action)
    Processes one decision and provides feedback
    
render()
    Shows current state and progress in human-readable format

Key Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
observation_space
    The range of data points the AI can see

action_space
    The possible decisions (0 for safe, 1 for phishing)

Performance Metrics
-----------------
The environment tracks:
- Accuracy of decisions
- Total reward accumulated
- Progress through the dataset
- Training completion status

This feedback helps in:
- Monitoring the AI's learning progress
- Identifying areas for improvement
- Measuring overall system effectiveness
